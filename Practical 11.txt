Title: Installation and Usage Guide for Oracle VirtualBox, Linux Installation, and C Programming with Vi Editor

Introduction:
Oracle VirtualBox is a powerful virtualization tool that allows users to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single physical machine. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing Oracle VirtualBox on a Windows system, setting up a Linux virtual machine within VirtualBox, and writing and compiling a C program using the Vi text editor on the Linux environment.

Installation Steps for Oracle VirtualBox on Windows:
1. Download the Oracle VirtualBox installer from the official website.
2. Double-click the installer to begin the installation process.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions, accepting the license agreement and selecting the desired installation options.
4. Once the installation is complete, launch Oracle VirtualBox from the Start menu.

Setting Up a Linux Virtual Machine:
1. Download the ISO image of the preferred Linux distribution (Mint/BOSS/Ubuntu) from the official website.
2. Open Oracle VirtualBox and click on the "New" button to create a new virtual machine.
3. Follow the wizard to set up the virtual machine, providing a name, selecting the type and version of Linux, and allocating memory and storage.
4. In the VirtualBox Manager, select the newly created virtual machine and click on the "Settings" button.
5. Navigate to the "Storage" tab and add the downloaded Linux ISO file to the virtual optical drive.
6. Start the virtual machine, and follow the on-screen instructions to install Linux within the virtual environment.

Using Vi Editor to Write a C Program:
1. Open the terminal in the Linux virtual machine.
2. Type `vi filename.c` to create a new C file and open it in the Vi editor.
3. Press 'i' to enter insert mode and start typing your C program.
4. To save the file, press `Esc` to exit insert mode, then type `:wq` and press `Enter`. This command saves the file and exits Vi.
5. To compile the C program, use the `gcc` compiler. For example: `gcc filename.c -o output`
6. To execute the compiled program, type `./output` in the terminal.

Common Vi Editor Commands:
- `i` : Enter insert mode
- `Esc` : Exit insert mode
- `:w` : Save changes
- `:q` : Quit Vi
- `:wq` : Save and quit
- `dd` : Delete a line
- `yy` : Copy a line
- `p` : Paste a copied line
- `:x` : Save and quit (alternative to `:wq`)

Conclusion:
By following these steps, users can successfully install Oracle VirtualBox on Windows, set up a Linux virtual machine, and write and compile a C program using the Vi editor. This provides a versatile environment for software development and experimentation.
